This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

### Author 
Adriano Silva

### Target device 
HTC Vive - SteamVR

## Versions
- Unity 2018.3.6f1
- SteamVR 2.2.0

## Emotion
The choosen emotion focused is “joy”, but more specifically “satisfaction”. Isn’t it satisfying watching a wood log split in two after a beautiful axe swing? What a joy of being in the middle of the forest, on a sunny day, hearing the birds singing, and doing some simple nice work like wood cutting with an axe. Simple pleasures of life.

## User tests 
#### Diegetic UI/Environment
* How do you feel in this world? What about your size? - "I feel good it's calming. My size seems to be normal."
	- It's the wanted feeling, nothing to change

	- He understood right the indications, nothing to change

#### Gamification/Scoring system
* Do you feel something good on doing the game? - "Not really, I don't feel enough satisfaction on cutting the logs. It's visually satisfying, but something is missing."
	- I added a sound on cutting and a vibration on the controller holding the axe
* Do you want to score more? - "I didn't really looked at the score, so I didn't know how I scored."
	- I created a second board and placed it in front of the stump
* What do you think about the scoring system? How does it count the points? - "It scores according to the cut equality, if it was right in the middle or not."
	- He understood the scoring system, nothing to change
